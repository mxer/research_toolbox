## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!
Start a GitHub issue if you have specific
functionality in mind that you found useful in your own experimental workflow
that you would like to discuss adding.
You are also free to fork the
repository and extend it for your personal usage or extract a subset of
the functionality and add it to your project.

I will keep extending the toolbox to suit my needs.
I am likely to devote more time improving the APIs for plotting, server interaction,
and folder manipulation. There is currently not much documentation, tests, or
tutorials.
The codebase is written in Python 2, but in its current state, it should be
mostly compatible with Python 3.
Making the code cross compatible with both Python 2 and 3 is not
my top priority, but I am happy to integrate contributed fixes.
Cross compatibility should be straightforward to implement as the codebase
is mostly composed of a set of loosely coupled utility functions.
Keep your pull requests short and focused as this will help with the
timely integration of your contributions.
Mimic the code style and naming conventions used in the rest of the codebase.
